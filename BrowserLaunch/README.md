# BrowserLaunch - Android Sample

This sample application is an example of an activity which launches a browser application on the device. 

The purpose of this sample is to demonstrate the ability to deploy wrapped widget applications to Secure Workspace.

Additionally, this sample demonstrates how Secure Workspace limits the intent chooser applications to the applications only in the workspace. In the context of this sample, the intent chooser will only allow the user to open the workspace browser application.
