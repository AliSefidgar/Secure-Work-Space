# SWS Auto-Resigner Script

The purpose of this script is to simplify the resigning of an iOS Secure Work Space app. Apps need to be re-signed after they are wrapped with BES. Wrapping an app invalidates it's previous signature. The manual process for wrapping an app is documented on [developer.blackberry.com](http://developer.blackberry.com/devzone/develop/enterprise/install_android_or_ios_work_space_app.html) and the [BES Universal Device Service Documentation](http://docs.blackberry.com/en/admin/deliverables/62506/BES10_v10.2.1_UDS_Advanced_Admin_Guide_en.pdf)
