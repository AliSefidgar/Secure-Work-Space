# SWS Auto-Resigner Script

The purpose of this script is to simplify the resigning of an iOS Secure Work Space app. Apps need to be re-signed after they are wrapped with BES. Wrapping an app invalidates it's previous signature. The manual process for wrapping an app is documented on [developer.blackberry.com](http://developer.blackberry.com/devzone/develop/enterprise/install_android_or_ios_work_space_app.html) and the [BES Universal Device Service Documentation](http://docs.blackberry.com/en/admin/deliverables/62506/BES10_v10.2.1_UDS_Advanced_Admin_Guide_en.pdf)

**Dependencies**

* OSX
* Xcode Command Line Tools
* BES Wrapped iOS App(the .ipa file)
* [iOS Enterprise Signing Keys](https://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/enterprise/)


**How to re-sign a wrapped app using this script**

1. Set Enviroment Variable SWSSIGNIDENTITY to the iOS Signing Identity
2. Set Enviroment Variable SWSWrappedAppFile to the full path to the wrapped app
3. Set Enviroment Variable SWSProvisioningProfile to the app Mobile Provisioning Profile (see Known Issues section below)

Example
```
export SWSSIGNIDENTITY="iPhone Distribution: My Company Name, LLC (45G34YW73X)"
export SWSWrappedAppFile="/Users/shikhir/sws/script/ECL-v5-wrapped-unsigned.ipa"
export SWSProvisioningProfile="/Users/shikhir/sws/ECLAppProfile.mobileprovision"
./SWSiOSResign
```

OR

Just type in ./SWSiOSResign and you will be prompted to enter the parameters

**Known Issues**

1. This script will not work if a wildcard mobile provisioning profile is used. Please sign manually according to the [docs](http://developer.blackberry.com/devzone/develop/enterprise/resign_work_space_app.html) if using a wildcard mobile provisioning profile is a must.
